**What I found:**
Summer is the hottest season, of course, but it looks like the most rain happens in [Check your monthly_summary result here] when the temperatures start to go down a little. The scatter plot shows that when it's super hot, the humidity is usually lower.

This data would be helpful for the campus to plan where to collect rainwater!
